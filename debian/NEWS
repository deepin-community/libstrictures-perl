libstrictures-perl (2.000001-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Citing from upstream's Changes file:

  * Incompatible Changes
    - strictures 2 fatalizes only a subset of warnings.  Some warning
      categories are not safe to catch, or just inappropriate to have fatal.
      Existing code looking like 'use strictures 1;' will continue to get the
      old behavior of fatalizing all errors.  The new behavior will take effect
      when no version or version 2 is specified.
